    "In the [last post]({filename}2020-07-13-linear-algebra-ols-regression.md) I talked about how to find the coefficients that give us the line of best fit for a OLS regression problem using the normal solution. The core of this approach is the equation:\n",

    "The way we solved this in the previous post was to pull out the system of simultaneous equations and solve these for $b$. However, a more straightforward way is to rewrite the equation by \"dividing\" both sides by $X^TX$, so that we are directly solving for $b$. If you remember back to [this post]({filename}2020-06-15-matrix-inversion.md), we need to multiply both sides of the equation by the inverse of $X^TX$ in order to do this:\n",

    "An orthonormal matrix is one where every column vector is an orthogonal unit vector. We have seen orthogonal vectors before: this simply means that the dot product of every pair of vectors in the matrix is $0$. Unit vectors are similarly straightforward - they are just vectors with a length of $1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why are orthonormal matrices so great for helping us find $b$? When we multiply an orthonormal matrix $Q$ by its transpose $Q^T$, we get the identity matrix; in other words, $Q^TQ = I$. Does the lefthand side of this equation look familiar? It's the exact part of $X^TXb = X^Ty$ that we tried to get rid of earlier by multiplying by the inverse. If we were able to use the orthonormal form of $X$, we could isolate $b$ without having to calculate the inverse at all, by simply calculating $b = Q^Ty$!\n",

    "## Turning $X$ into an orthonormal matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do we convert $X$ into an orthonormal matrix $Q$? The first step is to find **orthogonal** vectors, and the method we use is an extension of how we found $\\hat y$ and $e$ when trying to solve least squares for regression in the previous post. Those calculations essentially split $y$ into two orthogonal vectors: $\\hat y$ which lay on the plane of the column space $C(X)$, and $e$, the vector orthogonal to $C(X)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of the relationship between the first and second columns of $X$ as equivalent to the relationship between $C(X)$ and $y$. Let's call these columns $f$ and $g$, and their orthogonal versions $F$ and $G$. Essentially, we keep $f$ as is, so $f = F$. We then try to find the part of $g$ that lies on $F$ and the part that is orthogonal to it, $G$. \n",
    "\n",
    "In least squares, we would calculate $\\hat y$ using:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat y = X(X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F(F^TF)^{-1}F^Tg\n",
    "$$\n",

    "<img src=\"/figure/linear-algebra-5.png\" title=\"Creating orthogonal vectors\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto;\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, we can obviously only find orthogonal vectors when the vectors of $X$ are independent: if they are not, then _all_ of $g$ lies on the line described by $F$, and there would be no orthogonal part left behind.\n",

    "Finally, as we're now dealing entirely with vectors instead of a matrix, the terms $(F^TF)$ and $(F^Tg)$ simplify to scalars:\n",
