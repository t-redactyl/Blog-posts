    "If you followed along with my analysis of the top Christmas movies according to the MovieLens 10M dataset, you would remember I obtained the list of Christmas movies by [web scraping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping) this [page](http://www.timeout.com/london/film/the-50-best-christmas-movies). I am fairly new to web scraping, so this is one of my first serious attempts to get data in this manner. However, you can see that even with a basic understanding of how to find information in webpages it is relatively easy to extract the information you need. Hopefully this will help anyone also new to web scraping to get started."
