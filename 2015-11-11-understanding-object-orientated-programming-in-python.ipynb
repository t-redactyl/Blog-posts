    "When I first seriously decided to learn programming about 3 and a half years ago, I picked up Python using Zed Shaw's [**Learn Python the Hard Way**](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/). While an excellent introductory text for understanding programming for someone who had previously only cobbled together SPSS syntax, his explanation of object-orientated programming went completely over my head. I confess, I had spent the entire time since convinced I was incapable of understanding OOP! \n",
    "\n",
    "When refreshing my Python recently, I instead used the book [**Practical Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science Using Python**](http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Programming-Introduction-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/1934356271). This book had such a nice explanation of OOP that it (well, the basics at least!) finally clicked for me. I'll therefore use this blog post to hopefully assist someone else to conquer OOP using Python."

A type takes the form of a value or collection of values, and each have specific **methods** you can call on them. For example, a major type is a **list**. For an example, lets say we own a cattery and we want to keep track of the cats we have at the moment. We can store their names in a list:"

In this case, a method I have included to use temperament is `is_friendly`, which returns True when the cat is friendly and False otherwise. Additionally I have included an `if_weighs_more` method for weight, which takes a second \"threshold\" weight as an argument and returns True if the cat weighs more and False otherwise.
