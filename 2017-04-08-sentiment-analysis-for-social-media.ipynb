    "A few months ago at work, I was fortunate enough to see some excellent presentations by a group of data scientists at [Experian](http://www.experian.com.au/) regarding the analytics work they do. One of the presenters gave a demonstration of some work they were doing with sentiment analysis using a Python package called [VADER, or the Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment). After playing with it I realised how easy-to-use and powerful this package is, so let me talk you through how it works and how you can get up and running with it in this post! \n",

    "## To start, what is sentiment analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "[Sentiment analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis) is simply the process of working out (statistically) whether a piece of text is positive, negative or neutral. The majority of sentiment analysis approaches take one of two forms: **polarity-based**, where pieces of texts are classified as either positive or negative, or **valence-based**, where the intensity of the sentiment is taken into account. For example, the words 'good' and 'excellent' would be treated the same in a polarity-based approach, whereas 'excellent' would be treated as more positive than 'good' in a valence-based approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment analysis has applications across a range of industries - it's great for anything where you can get unstructured opinion data about a service or product. One application of sentiment analysis is for companies that have Twitter or other social media accounts to receive feedback. Obviously it's bad business for these companies to leave negative feedback unanswered too long, and sentiment analysis can give them a quick way to find and prioritise these unhappy customers. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How does VADER work?\n",
    "\n",
    "VADER belongs to a type of sentiment analysis that is based on lexicons of sentiment-related words. In this approach, each of the words in the lexicon is rated as to whether it is positive or negative, and in many cases, **how** positive or negative. Below you can see an excerpt from VADER's lexicon, where more positive words have higher positive ratings and more negative words have lower negative ratings."

    "To work out whether these words are positive or negative (and optionally, to what degree), the developers of these approaches need to get a bunch of people to manually rate them, which is obviously pretty expensive and time-consuming. In addition, the lexicon needs to have good coverage of the words in your text of interest, otherwise it won't be very accurate. On the flipside, when there is a good fit between the lexicon and the text, this approach is accurate, and additionally quickly returns results even on large amounts of text. Incidentally, the developers of VADER used Amazon's Mechanical Turk to get most of their ratings, which is a very quick and cheap way to get their ratings!\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might have guessed, when VADER analyses a piece of text it checks to see if any of the words in the text are present in the lexicon. For example, the sentence \"The food is good and the atmosphere is nice\" has two words in the lexicon (good and nice) with ratings of 1.9 and 1.8 respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "VADER produces four sentiment metrics from these word ratings, which you can see below. The first three, positive, neutral and negative, represent the proportion of the text that falls into those categories. As you can see, our example sentence was rated as 45% positive, 55% neutral and 0% negative. The final metric, the compound score, is the sum of all of the lexicon ratings (1.9 and 1.8 in this case) which have been standardised to range between -1 and 1. In this case, our example sentence has a rating of 0.69, which is pretty strongly positive."
